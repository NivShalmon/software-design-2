1. moved the function storeToStorage that was used by both Dict and DoubleKetDict to its own class called Util
2. changed the app so it doesn't user get
3. changed the way we compose some of the CompletableFuture's in the library to ensure proper call order (in Dict, DoubleKetDict, BinarySearch and Util)
